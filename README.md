# the-super-tiny-liveview

## why

There are lots of cool liveview implementations out there already!

I wanted to break down the concept as simply as I could to get a good understanding of how they work behind the scenes.

Along the way I thought maybe a tiny example without many dependencies or features would help me & others understand how LiveView style webapps function.

The focus now is sharpening it into a tiny, fun DSL to make quick & dirty multiplayer apps simple to build.

*DANGER*

*This was not built with performance and best-practices in mind!*

*If you use this in prod you might be sad*

## how

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.tsx
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
